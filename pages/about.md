# About Me

Currently studying Data Science with the dream of working for a major corporation which specializes in the future of AI. My passion is to advance the technology of artificial intelligence to the certainty of self-independence so they can make their own choices. While also obeying commands put at hand, the AI would be able to use critical skills and problem solving skills to simulate a task that a human could do. We have seen this sort of advancements with OpenAI which is working on a project related to AGI, artifical general intelligence, which essentially is a much more advanced prototype in which this type of idea could be plausible to achieve.
